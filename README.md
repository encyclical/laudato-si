# Laudato Si’

View the site on [Github Pages](http://jasonphillips.github.io/laudato-si/).

This site offers a mirror of the
[official document](http://w2.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/encyclicals/documents/papa-francesco_20150524_enciclica-laudato-si.html) Laudato Si’ that is hosted on the Vatican site. All contents belong to Libreria Editrice Vaticana and are
repeated here merely for educational purposes. My hope is to better facilitate public reading of the
encyclical by making it more accessible and convenient for online reading.

**Features:**
 - properly ordered headers
 - cleaner typography
 - responsive layout

Improvements welcome via pull request.
